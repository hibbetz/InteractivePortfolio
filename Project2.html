            <p> This is the second project worked on under the OpenClassroom Web Developer course and features basic HTML and CSS code with some minor responsiveness implimentation. A key part of the project was using Github to version control my site as I made changes. There is also some implimentation of a webhosting site in order to get my website fully accessible to evryone. All code is hand done without the use of a framework. </p>
            <p> I broke the project down into 2 major parts:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> HTML </li>
              <li> CSS </li>
            </ul>

        <div class="col-xl-6 jobs">
          <h2 class="TitleText"> HTML </h2>
          <br>
          <p> This section focuses on my basic HTML skills ranging from simple things from headers and paragraphs to some slightly less basic attriubtes and image tags. I had tried to keep my HTML and CSS as separate as possible for the first project so i could accurately test my new skillset. Rather than keeping things bland and simple with just normal tags i decided to make the project a touch more complex by adding things like: interactable hyperlinks that take you to pages or email addresses for contact and to incorporating a sidebar to outline my minor skills. The main tags used were: headers, paragraphs, body, head, images, attributes, articles, divs and lists.  </p>

          <p> This section focuses on my basic CSS skills. As this was the first attempt at CSS coding, i had decided to steer clear of frameworks like Bootstrap and had decided to do it all by hand to test the things i had learned during the course. I had implimented IDs, classes with their own styling using the standard # or . to show what was being changed (. being a class and # being an ID). I had used a combination of styling techniques ranging from CSS default colouring system (using colour names) to using hex values to get a more personal and specific colouring. Besides that i had mostly stuck to the default CSS syntax and tags like: font family, font size, padding, margins, etc.
