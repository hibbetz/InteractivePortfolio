            <p> This is the second project worked on under the OpenClassroom Web Developer course and features basic HTML and CSS code with some minor responsiveness implimentation. A key part of the project was using Github to version control my site as I made changes. There is also some implimentation of a webhosting site in order to get my website fully accessible to evryone. All code is hand done without the use of a framework. </p>
            <p> I broke the project down into 3 major parts:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> HTML </li>
              <li> CSS </li>
              <li> Github and Hosting </li>
            </ul>

          <p> This section focuses more on figuring out what is required from the position of a Junior Web Developer. Starting off it was most important to discover the general location of the mock company, which was Brooklyn, New York. From there it was important to find out how the existing web companies there operate and how they present themselves in their job descriptions i.e. were they more of a hip and current market more in tune to the younger generation or are they more professional and formal?</p>
          <p> Once that was completed, I then had to decide what was most applicatble for a Junior Developer and what, realistically, they should be able to do at that stage in their career. Eventually it was narrowed down to things like: good HTML and CSS practices and proven skill in creating basic website functions, proficency in using Git or other Version Control platforms, experience in working in a team setting and good problem solving ability. </p>

          <p> This section focuses more on developing the skills a new hire should already have based on the job description previously. It outlines the skills they have already, what skill they will develop or improve, how they will do this (tasks, homework, mentoring, etc.), how this can be measured (quantifiable like a certain amount of bug fixes), when these can be achieved by within the 3 month probationary period and who it is relevant to (person growth, the team, the management or the business as a whole).
